					<ul>
						<li>
							<span class="list_headline">22A3-1 Assault Rifle</span><br />
							- The 22A3-1 is the standard issue offensive weapon for an Interstellar Armed Forces soldier. Firing high velocity, explosive tipped rounds at a rate of roughly 900 rpm, this weapon can tear through most opponents in seconds. Standard clip size is 95 rounds. The 22A3-1 model also comes fitted with an underslung grenade launcher for heavy fire situations.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="list_headline">Model 35 Pump-action Shotgun</span><br />
							- A traditional manually operated pump-action shotgun, firing 12-guage rounds. Favoured for its powerful, close range, wide-spread blast. The receiver is designed to hold up to 12 magnum shells.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="list_headline">M868 Flamer Unit</span><br />
							- The M868 uses a highly pressurized napalm-based fuel which sticks to any targets caught in the blast as it burns. Great care must be used to ensure the firing area is clear from friendly personnel, especially when used on the move.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="list_headline">S23A SynTek 'Smart-Eye' Autogun</span><br />
							- The Syntek S23A Autogun is among the most advanced squad assault weapons currently available. Featuring a sophisticated tracking system and a powerful electromagnetic field inducer chamber, this weapon can identify hostile targets and automatically alter the trajectory of bullets as they leave the weapon to ensure a hit. It fires explosive tipped caseless rounds at around 1200rpm. These heavy weapons can only be used by marines specially trained in their use.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="list_headline">M73 Pistol</span><br />
							- The M73 has been the IAF standard sidearm for the past sixty years. Renowned for its reliability and lightweight, it is a sure last resort for a marine who finds himself without his main weapon.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="list_headline">Ammo Bag</span><br />
							- A standard issue IAF pack containing extra ammo for the marine's weapons. The standard issue IAF pack is a lightweight, water and heat resistant backpack which clips securely onto the marine's armour frame.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="list_headline">IAF Advanced Sentry Gun</span><br />
							- The ASG is a highly efficient, fully automated sentry gun, capable of friend/foe identification based on a large number of parameters including biological make-up and wide-band image recognition scans. It consists of a heavy guage autocannon mounted on a user-adjustable rotating stand.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="list_headline">SM75 Flares</span><br />
							- The SM75 flares are a special magnesium flare developed by the SynTek Megacorporation in conjunction with the 22A3-1 Assault Rifle. The flares have a dual role, the first being to provide light over an area when activated. The flares also give out a key wavelength of reflective light which aids the targetting of the Assault Rifle - such that the rifle will lock onto any foe caught in the magnesium glow.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="list_headline">Hacking Tool</span><br />
							- An advanced IAF tech-issue 'circuit breaker' hacking device, developed in the high security IAF labs. Offering a variety of intelligent circuit analyzers and bypassing logic gate systems, this tool can only be used by a marine trained in electronic tech systems.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="list_headline">Hand Welder</span><br />
							- This IAF issue hand welder uses a self-recharging battery pack capable of generating a super-hot plasma stream. This is generally used in the field to seal or cut through doors to offer the IAF marines a tactical advantage.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="list_headline">Medical Satchel</span><br />
							- A standard issue IAF pack containing medical supplies for use in the field by a trained medic. The pack has enough supplies to treat a number of wounded marines. The standard issue IAF pack is a lightweight, water and heat resistant backpack which clips securely onto the marine's armour frame.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="list_headline">Personal Medikit</span><br />
							- A small first aid kit for treating personal wounds in the field. Can be used by any marine. Developed by SynTek Pharmaceutical Division.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="list_headline">Reactions Stim Pack</span><br />
							- A powerful injection fresh from the SynTek Pharmaceutical Division. In times of great danger, IAF troops can apply this stim pack, giving themselves heightened reactions and senses. Though short-lived, this drug can mean the difference between life and death in a tough spot.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="list_headline">M478 Proximity Incendiary Mines</span><br />
							- An 8 piece set of M478 Proximity Incendiary Mines is standard issue for any explosives trained soldier. These mines are placed and calibrated in the field and once activated will detonate when any creature matching the specifications comes near. Upon detonation, highly flammable plasma is released in a line either side of the mine, used to both kill the victim and tactically seal off the area from further foes.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="list_headline">Thermal Scanner</span><br />
							- The IAF Thermal Scanner is used by marines to track nearby kinetic energy sources. It works on a pulse system, regularly notifying the marine of any movement nearby through the use of an on-screen display and an audible distance/pitch beep.
