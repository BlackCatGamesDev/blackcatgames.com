<h1>How To Place Objectives</h1>
Placing objectives in Ao is quite simple.  Each objective is a single actor, you simply
drop all the objectives you require into your map.  For objectives with
specific targets, you can bring up their properties and edit them as required.

<ul>
<li>First of all, place down an <b>AoMissionInfo</b> actor.  This serves as a place to keep all your mission objectives.  This can be found under Actor->Info->AoInfo->AoMissionInfo.
<br><br>
<li>Objectives can be found under Actor->Info->AoInfo->AoMissionObjective.  (AoObjectives.u will need to be loaded).  Browse through these and find one you want.
<br><br>
<li>Simply add the objectives you require to your level, organising them inside the AoMissionInfo actor, as shown:
<br><br>
<img src="images/objectives.jpg">
<br><br>
The order in which they are arranged here in the editor is the order in which they will show on the player's objective list ingame.
<br><br>
<li>Remember: do not add all of the objectives (like in the pic above), else all the levels will end up the same.  Pick one or two objectives for your map to keep them all unique.
<br><br>
<li>You can bring up an objective's properties and set a number of things:
<ul><li>bOptional - if set, this objective is an optional one.
<li>ShortName and Description - the text of the objective.
<li>PointsAwarded - how many points the player gets for finishing this objective.
<li>ObjectivePic - It also possible to have a picture show up with the objective, by putting the appropriate texture name in the ObjectivePic property.  For example
pictures that fit here, check AoObjectivePics.utx.
</ul>

</ul>
<b>KillAllAliensObjective</b>

<ul><li>This objective is for 'last stand' type missions.  The players have to survive for X minutes, after which time the mission will be completed.
You would typically send waves of aliens at the players constantly, they would have to set up positions and defences, etc, so they last the time.
In the objective's properties, you can set:
<ul><li>TimeLimitMinutes - how long you have to survive for.
<li>bMustBeInExitZone - if set then if players aren't in a zone with ZoneTag 'Exit' when the timelimit hits, they fail.

</ul></ul>

too.  You can find it under Actor->Decoration->AoObject->AoUsableObject-><b>AoObjectFilesComputer</b>.  Note: If you have multiple copies of
this objective, then match the computer's Event to the objective's Tag for each pair.
